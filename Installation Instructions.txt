Customising the theme

	A custom logo
	1. Create/find an image that you will use as logo.
	2. Go to the bottom of your stylesheet and find the "custom logo css"
	3. Under "top" you can change how much the image is moved from the top of the page. ~50px is usually ok.
	4. Change the "width" to the total width of your logo image.
	5. Change the "margin-left" to 50% of that width. 
	6. Change the "height" to the height of your logo image. If you also have a hover state in the same image (like the /r/Naut logo) you need to make the height ONLY one image high. 
	7. Change the "background-position" to minus that height.
	8. Upload your image as "logo" and save!

	Custom Subscriber text / Submit page text
	1. Scroll up a bit from the bottom of the stylesheet, to just above the custom logo CSS.
	2. Change the text within the " " to change it.

	Images in userflairs
	1. This is explained in this reddit post: http://redd.it/1rtz5j
